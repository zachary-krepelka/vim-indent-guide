# indent-guide.vim

This plugin provides an indentation guide for the Vim text editor. The user can
dynamically adjust the textwidth and tabstop using a visual aid. Facilities are
also provided for altering the indentation of a file, i.e., changing spaces to
tabs and vice versa. Use your favorite plugin manager for installation. I'm
still working on the documentation.
